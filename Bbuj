To fix the issue where users encounter an infinite loading GIF and the application doesn't function properly when they navigate back, you need to ensure that the state is properly managed and transitions correctly.

Here are some steps to address the problem:

1. **Check JavaScript Event Handling:**
   Make sure that your JavaScript event listeners are correctly set up and removed when the user navigates. If you have event listeners on buttons or other elements, ensure they are properly managed.

2. **Manage Application State:**
   Ensure your application state is correctly preserved when users navigate back. You might be using libraries like React, Vue, or Angular. Each has its own way of handling state and component lifecycles.

3. **Correct AJAX/Fetch Handling:**
   Ensure that any AJAX or fetch requests are properly handled and canceled if the user navigates away. This prevents stale requests from causing issues.

4. **Proper URL Handling:**
   Ensure the URLs and routing in your application are correctly managed. For example, if you're using a front-end router like React Router, Vue Router, or Angular Router, make sure the routes are correctly defined and transitions are handled smoothly.

5. **Use Browser History API:**
   Make sure you correctly handle the browser's history API. When a user clicks the back button, your application should handle it gracefully. You might need to use `window.onpopstate` to manage state transitions.

6. **Loading State Management:**
   Ensure your loading state is properly managed. The infinite loading GIF indicates that the loading state isn't correctly reset. Make sure to set and reset the loading state appropriately.

Here's a basic example in JavaScript:

```javascript
window.onpopstate = function(event) {
  // Handle the back button click
  handleNavigation(event);
};

function handleNavigation(event) {
  // Logic to manage state and component re-rendering
  if (event.state) {
    // Reset loading state
    document.getElementById('loadingGif').style.display = 'none';
    
    // Load the appropriate content based on the state
    loadContent(event.state);
  } else {
    // Initial state or no state available
    loadInitialContent();
  }
}

function loadContent(state) {
  // Your logic to load the content based on the state
}

function loadInitialContent() {
  // Your logic to load the initial content
}

// Example of setting a state and pushing to history
function navigateTo(newState) {
  history.pushState(newState, '', newState.url);
  handleNavigation({ state: newState });
}
```

Adjust this code to fit your specific framework and use case. By properly managing state and navigation, you should be able to prevent infinite loading issues and ensure smooth user experience.
